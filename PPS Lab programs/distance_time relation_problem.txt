/*A building has 10 floors with a floor height of 3 meters each. A ball is dropped from the 
top of the building. Find the time taken by the ball to reach each floor. (Use the formula 
s = ut+(1/2)at^2 
where u and a are the initial velocity in m/sec (= 0) and acceleration in m/sec^2 
(= 9.8 m/s^2)).*/
